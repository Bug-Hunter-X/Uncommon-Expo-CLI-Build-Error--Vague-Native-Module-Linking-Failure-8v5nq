While building an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error during the linking process. The error message was vague, mentioning an issue with native modules, but not specifying the exact problem or the module causing it.  The build process would fail without any clear indication of the root cause.  The project's dependencies were all correctly installed according to package.json. I have tried reinstalling node modules, clearing the cache, and even creating a new project from scratch, but the problem persisted.  The error output varied slightly from attempt to attempt and provided minimal debug information.
